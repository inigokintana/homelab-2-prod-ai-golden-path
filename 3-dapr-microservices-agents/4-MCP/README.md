**Caution WIP**

To be able to provide an OSS stack we have chosen Dapr in our golden path (opinionated shortcut) and Dapr has its own MCP path:
 - Please see [Dapr Agents Framework and Roadmap](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents/blob/249ea5ec43f75825f662992e765cb09b5fd31695/README.md)
 - [MCP issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents/issues/50)
 - You know, OSS sometimes goes ahead, some other times do not and we need to wait or contribute.
