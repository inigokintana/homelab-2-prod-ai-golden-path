We got a database with 3 tables with web tech data, pdf docs tech data and forums tech data. Using pgai vectorizer all 3 tables have its corresponding web_embedding, pdf_embedding and  forums_embedding tabke data vectorized. Is it best practice to select with UNION ALL the 3 tables embedding to provide to LLM the RAG results?





Yes, using a `UNION ALL` across the three embedding tables (`web_embedding`, `pdf_embedding`, and `forums_embedding`) **is a reasonable and often effective approach** for combining heterogeneous data sources in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. But there are some best practices and considerations you should follow to make this setup optimal.

---

### ‚úÖ **Best Practice: Use `UNION ALL` for Combined Retrieval**
You can define a unified view or query like:

```sql
SELECT 'web' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM web_embedding
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pdf' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM pdf_embedding
UNION ALL
SELECT 'forums' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM forums_embedding;
```

Then you can perform a **vector similarity search** against this combined dataset using `pgvector` and `pgai` functions like:

```sql
SELECT source, id, text, embedding
FROM (
    SELECT 'web' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM web_embedding
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'pdf' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM pdf_embedding
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'forums' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM forums_embedding
) AS combined
ORDER BY embedding <=> pgai.embed('your question here')
LIMIT 5;
```

### üìå Key Considerations

#### 1. **Embedding Model Consistency**
Ensure all tables used the **same embedding model** (e.g., `pgai.embed(model => 'WhereIsAI/UAE-Large-V1')`). Otherwise, distances may be incomparable.

#### 2. **Schema Consistency**
Make sure the embedding columns and text formats are aligned ‚Äî ideally same column names and dimensions, so you can `UNION ALL` cleanly.

#### 3. **Use Materialized Views (Optional Optimization)**
If the union is expensive, you can use a **materialized view** to cache and index the unioned results:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW combined_embedding AS
SELECT 'web' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM web_embedding
UNION ALL
SELECT 'pdf' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM pdf_embedding
UNION ALL
SELECT 'forums' AS source, id, text, embedding FROM forums_embedding;
```

You can then index `embedding` using `ivfflat` or `hnsw` for faster ANN search:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON combined_embedding USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

#### 4. **Source Attribution in LLM Output**
Since you preserve the `source` in the union, the LLM can cite whether the answer comes from a forum, a PDF, or a web page, which improves trust and traceability.

---

### ‚ùå What to Avoid

- **Mixing incompatible embeddings**: If one table uses a different model, the similarity scores won't be meaningful.
- **Overloading the LLM context**: Always limit `LIMIT N` based on context size and information density, not just raw number of chunks.

---

### ‚úÖ Bonus Tip: Filtering Before Vector Search
If you already know the type of query (e.g. "about forum discussions on Kubernetes"), it can be more efficient to **filter the source** first:

```sql
SELECT id, text
FROM forums_embedding
ORDER BY embedding <=> pgai.embed('your question') 
LIMIT 5;
```

This reduces noise and improves relevance.

*************
Using `UNION ALL` to combine embeddings from your three tables (web, PDF, forums) into a single result set for RAG is generally a good and common practice, but with some important considerations to make it truly effective.

Here's why it's a good approach and what best practices you should follow:

**Why UNION ALL is generally a good approach:**

* **Unified Search Space:** By combining the embeddings, you create a single, unified vector space where the LLM can search for relevant information regardless of its original source. This allows for a more comprehensive retrieval and potentially better answers.
* **Simplicity for Retrieval:** Your RAG pipeline can then perform a single vector similarity search against this combined embedding set, simplifying the retrieval logic compared to querying each table separately and then merging the results.
* **Diverse Context:** Each source (web, PDF, forums) likely contains unique types of information or perspectives on technical data. Combining them provides the LLM with a richer and more diverse set of context, reducing the likelihood of knowledge gaps.

**Best Practices and Considerations:**

1.  **Metadata Preservation:**
    * **Crucial for Attribution and Filtering:** When you `UNION ALL` the embeddings, ensure you also bring along metadata that indicates the **original source** (e.g., `source_type TEXT`, `source_url TEXT`, `document_title TEXT`, `forum_thread_id INT`).
    * **Why?**
        * **Attribution:** The LLM can cite its sources, increasing trustworthiness and allowing users to delve deeper.
        * **Filtering:** You might want to filter results based on source type (e.g., "only show me results from official PDF documentation"). This is a powerful RAG technique.
        * **Hybrid Search:** Metadata can be used for keyword-based filtering before or after vector similarity search, which can improve precision.

2.  **Chunking Strategy Consistency (or intentional variation):**
    * While `pgai vectorizer` handles chunking, consider if the chunking strategy (e.g., chunk size, overlap) used for each data type (web, PDF, forums) is appropriate.
    * **Consistency:** Ideally, for similar content, you'd want similar chunking to ensure embeddings are comparable.
    * **Intentional Variation:** However, PDF documents might benefit from different chunking (e.g., by page, by section) than forum posts (e.g., by individual post). `pgai vectorizer` allows you to define chunking rules, so ensure these align with the nature of the data in each table.

3.  **Embedding Model Consistency:**
    * You mentioned `pgai vectorizer` handles the vectorization. It's generally best practice to use the *same embedding model* (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-ada-002`) for all your data sources.
    * **Why?** Different embedding models create embeddings in different vector spaces. Combining embeddings from disparate models can lead to less effective similarity searches as the "distances" between vectors won't be consistently meaningful across the different models' outputs. `pgai vectorizer` makes this easy by allowing you to specify the embedding model.

4.  **Querying the Combined Set:**
    * Your RAG pipeline will receive a user query. This query should also be vectorized using the **same embedding model** used for your stored data.
    * Then, you perform a similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity) against the `UNION ALL` result set of embeddings.

5.  **Relevance and Redundancy Handling:**
    * When you retrieve `k` most similar embeddings, you might get results from different sources that are very similar or even redundant.
    * Consider post-retrieval processing:
        * **Re-ranking:** Use a re-ranker model to score the retrieved chunks based on their relevance to the query, providing a more refined order for the LLM.
        * **De-duplication:** If chunks from different sources are almost identical in content, you might want to de-duplicate them to avoid feeding redundant information to the LLM.
        * **Summarization/Consolidation:** For very long retrieved contexts, you might want to summarize or consolidate information before sending it to the LLM, especially if the LLM has context window limitations.

6.  **Performance:**
    * `UNION ALL` itself is efficient in PostgreSQL. The primary performance consideration will be the vector similarity search on the combined dataset.
    * Ensure your `web_embedding`, `pdf_embedding`, and `forums_embedding` tables (or the combined view/table you use for search) have appropriate vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF). `pgai vectorizer` is designed to automatically optimize search performance with vector indexes.

**Example SQL (Conceptual):**

```sql
SELECT
    web_embedding AS embedding_vector,
    content_text, -- The original text chunk
    'web' AS source_type,
    url AS source_identifier,
    NULL AS doc_title,
    NULL AS forum_thread_id
FROM
    web_data_embeddings -- Assuming this is your web_embedding table

UNION ALL

SELECT
    pdf_embedding AS embedding_vector,
    content_text,
    'pdf' AS source_type,
    NULL AS source_identifier,
    document_title AS doc_title,
    NULL AS forum_thread_id
FROM
    pdf_data_embeddings -- Assuming this is your pdf_embedding table

UNION ALL

SELECT
    forum_embedding AS embedding_vector,
    content_text,
    'forum' AS source_type,
    NULL AS source_identifier,
    NULL AS doc_title,
    thread_id AS forum_thread_id
FROM
    forum_data_embeddings -- Assuming this is your forums_embedding table
ORDER BY
    embedding_vector <=> your_query_embedding -- For similarity search
LIMIT 5; -- Retrieve top 5 most relevant
```

In summary, `UNION ALL` is a very sensible approach for combining embeddings from different sources for RAG. The key to making it robust and effective lies in carefully managing metadata, ensuring embedding model consistency, and considering post-retrieval processing for optimal LLM context. `pgai vectorizer`'s capabilities for automated embedding and indexing will greatly assist in this process.
