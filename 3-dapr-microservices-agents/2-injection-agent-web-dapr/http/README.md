This is the same functionality as 2-injection-agent-web-dapr but without using Dapr sdk.

So every call is HTTP.

We encorauge using Dapr sdk to increase code portability as we can easily change database component or secret provider.

We leave the code for comparison and educational purposes

Please refer to [2-injection-agent-web-dapr/README.md](../2-injection-agent-web-dapr/README.md)
