Most people only see AI agents on the surface, but the real power lies deep in the stack.

Here’s a breakdown of the hidden layers that make AI agents work.
It covers front-end tools, memory, authentication, orchestration, routing, models, infra, and more.

Each section reveals the technologies powering today’s intelligent agent ecosystem.

1. AI agents
Apps like Perplexity, Cursor, Harvey, and Devin represent the visible tip of the iceberg—the user-facing side of agents.

2. Front-end layer
Frameworks like React, Streamlit, Flask, and Gradio allow users to interact with agents through apps, dashboards, and chat UIs.

3. Memory systems
Zep, Memo, Cognce, and Letta give agents memory, enabling them to recall past interactions and build contextual intelligence.

4. Authentication
Tools like Auth0, Okta, and OpenFGA handle user identity, ensuring secure, role-based access to agent-powered systems.

5. External tools
Google, DuckDuckGo, and Wolfram Alpha APIs expand agent capabilities beyond language, powering search, reasoning, and calculations.

6. Observability
LangSmith, Langfuse, PromptLayer, and Arize track performance, debugging, and logs—making agents transparent and accountable.

7. Agent authentication
Services like AWS Agent Identity and Azure Agent ID authenticate agents themselves, enabling trust between autonomous systems.

8. Orchestration
LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Informatica coordinate agent workflows, integrating memory, tools, and models into structured pipelines.

9. Agent protocols
Standards like MCP, A2A Protocol, and IBM’s ACP let agents communicate, collaborate, and transfer data seamlessly across systems.

10. Model routing
Platforms like Martian, OpenRouter, and Not Diamond optimize how agents pick the best foundation model for a given task.

11. Foundation models
LLMs like OpenAI, Anthropic’s Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Qwen provide the intelligence layer that powers agent reasoning.

12. Databases
Chroma, Pinecone, Neo4j, Supabase, and Weaviate store structured and vector data for retrieval-augmented intelligence.

13. Infrastructure
Docker, Kubernetes, and auto-scaling VMs form the base compute layer, keeping agents reliable and scalable at massive levels.

14. Compute providers
NVIDIA, AWS, and Azure supply the GPUs and CPUs that make training and running large agents possible.

15. ETL pipelines
Informatica and similar platforms handle extraction, transformation, and loading of data into agent-accessible systems.

AI agents may look simple, but under the surface lies an entire stack of memory, models, protocols, and infrastructure.
