8 RAG architectures for AI Engineers:

(explained with usage)

1) Naive RAG
- Retrieves documents purely based on vector similarity between the query embedding and stored embeddings.
- Works best for simple, fact-based queries where direct semantic matching suffices.

2) Multimodal RAG
- Handles multiple data types (text, images, audio, etc.) by embedding and retrieving across modalities.
- Ideal for cross-modal retrieval tasks like answering a text query with both text and image context.

3) HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)
- Queries are not semantically similar to documents.
- This technique generates a hypothetical answer document from the query before retrieval.
- Uses this generated documentâ€™s embedding to find more relevant real documents.

4) Corrective RAG
- Validates retrieved results by comparing them against trusted sources (e.g., web search).
- Ensures up-to-date and accurate information, filtering or correcting retrieved content before passing to the LLM.

5) Graph RAG
- Converts retrieved content into a knowledge graph to capture relationships and entities.
- Enhances reasoning by providing structured context alongside raw text to the LLM.

6) Hybrid RAG
- Combines dense vector retrieval with graph-based retrieval in a single pipeline.
- Useful when the task requires both unstructured text and structured relational data for richer answers.

7) Adaptive RAG
- Dynamically decides if a query requires a simple direct retrieval or a multi-step reasoning chain.
- Breaks complex queries into smaller sub-queries for better coverage and accuracy.

8) Agentic RAG
- Uses AI agents with planning, reasoning (ReAct, CoT), and memory to orchestrate retrieval from multiple sources.
- Best suited for complex workflows that require tool use, external APIs, or combining multiple RAG techniques.
