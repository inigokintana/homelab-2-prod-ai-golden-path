Pending:
- Optimizing perf - cpu bottleneck - chek in AWS
- OpenTofu Hetzner - doing
- Dapr Ai agents & MCP
- Video / script / Demo
- sanitize code - logging
- Nginx ingress - too many ports??

- what would you use inside kubernetes for ai agents, semantic kernel or dapr?
thanks but have you considered dapr has workflow capabilities?

Dapr = infrastructure glue → Makes your AI agent connect to services seamlessly.
Semantic Kernel = agent brain wiring → Makes your AI agent think and remember in structured ways.
In practice, they are complementary, not competing.


Goal	Best pick
Need your AI agent to orchestrate multiple LLM calls, manage prompts/memory	Semantic Kernel
Need your AI agent to talk to databases, queues, APIs, and survive service changes without rewrites	Dapr
Need both orchestration & infra glue	Run SK inside a Dapr-enabled microservice
Dapr’s Workflow API changes the picture a bit because it means you could, in theory, build an “AI agent” purely in Dapr without Semantic Kernel if your orchestration needs are more event-driven than reasoning-driven.

can you explain me when to use Dapr Workflows vs semantic kernel vs Google A2A protocol for agent coordination?

Situation	Best Choice
You need reliable, stateful execution of multi-step processes (minutes–days), with retries & durability	Dapr Workflows
You need LLM-driven decision-making & function chaining	Semantic Kernel
You need agents from different frameworks/vendors to talk to each other	Google A2A
You need both reliability & reasoning	SK inside a Dapr Workflow (hybrid)
You need cross-vendor AI ecosystems	A2A with Dapr or SK as the local orchestrator
