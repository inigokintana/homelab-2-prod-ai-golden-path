RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs Prompt Engineering 

• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 
 - Fetches real-time, external information. 
 - No need for model retraining. 
 - Perfect for dynamic or domain-specific data. 
 - Significantly boosts response relevance. 
 - Seamlessly integrates into existing workflows. 

• Fine-Tuning 
 - Involves retraining the model with domain-specific data. 
 - Achieves high accuracy for particular tasks. 
 - Provides consistent, specialized performance. 
 - Requires labeled data and additional training time. 
 - Best suited for long-term projects with stable needs. 

• Prompt Engineering 
 - Focuses on refining prompts for better output. 
 - No retraining of the model is necessary. 
 - Offers rapid, cost-effective improvements. 
 - Highly flexible across different tasks. 
 - Instantly deployable perfect for trial and error.
