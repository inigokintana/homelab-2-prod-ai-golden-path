Europe is having geopolitical trouble with IT dominance from non European companies.

This is why, in this section, we try to install all these OSS projects in an European public Cloud provider as OVH or Hetzner using OpenTofu.

OpenTofu has also an OpenNebula, helm and kubectl providers. Openebula & Virt8era is another Europe sovereing cloud initiative, see [link1](https://opennebula.io/innovation/virt8ra/) and [link2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGpCeoqtHWg).
